Hi guys. I've included the ogg files for the recorders along with the subtitles that go with them in the other text document. 
The text for the documents are also there. The Russian stuff is just the translation of the English that follows it. Figured that would make it more realistic.
Kyle, you have access to the google doc that contains the same information as that text document so either or will work. 
Just figured it might make it easier to copy and paste.
